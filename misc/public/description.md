The evil UrRaNdOm from Race After Non-Determinstic Online Machines aka R.A.N.D.O.M is about to randomise all the binary files in the world. Agent Abstract died trying to neutralize him. All he left us with is this weird little riddle:

I came and left,  
gone with this incredible theft.  
Just laughing at your riddled face,  
as you don't seem to get my trace.  
An when we meet again,  
you will feel estranged,  
there is a faint of pain,  
as I myself have changed.

Hints: Take a look at the example.c file
       and by the way, it's base85 encoding ;-)
